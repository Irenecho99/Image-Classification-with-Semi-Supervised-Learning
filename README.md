# Abstract:
In the experiment, our goal is to use semisupervised learning to complete the task of image classification. There are 200 classes in our dataset, with
50 labeled images and 450 unlabeled images in each class. For the dataset, we deal with the training set, unlabeled data, validation set, and test set separately. At the same time, we use the Pseudo-Label method for semi-supervised learning. When comes to model selection, our neural network model uses the DenseNet model. We got the result with the training of our data on Nvidia 2080Ti, and meantime we saved the model to the personal computer to predict the class label of our test data.
